Genome Assembly as Shortest Superstring problem solution

Problem:
For a collection of strings, a larger string containing every one of the smaller strings as a substring is called a superstring.

By the assumption of parsimony, a shortest possible superstring over a collection of reads serves as a candidate chromosome.

Given: At most 50 DNA strings of approximately equal length, not exceeding 1 kbp, in FASTA format (which represent reads deriving from the same strand of a single linear chromosome).

The dataset is guaranteed to satisfy the following condition: there exists a unique way to reconstruct the entire chromosome from these reads by gluing together pairs of reads that overlap by more than half their length.

Return: A shortest superstring containing all the given strings (thus corresponding to a reconstructed chromosome).



Sample Data Set:
>Rosalind_56
ATTAGACCTG
>Rosalind_57
CCTGCCGGAA
>Rosalind_58
AGACCTGCCG
>Rosalind_59
GCCGGAATAC

Sample Output: 
ATTAGACCTGCCGGAATAC
